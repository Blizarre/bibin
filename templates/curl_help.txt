Hello and Welcome to the Curl interface

To add / delete / update a paste you will need to provide the password. Bibin support both
Basic authentication (any username but with the right password) and the X-API-Key token.


# Add a new paste
$ curl -X PUT -u "anything:YOUR_PASSWORD" --data 'hello world' {{root_url}}
# returns: {{root_url}}/cateettary

# Fetch a paste
$ curl {{root_url}}/cateettary
hello world

# Delete a paste
$ curl -X DELETE -H "X-API-Key:YOUR_PASSWORD" {{root_url}}/cateettary

# Upload a new paste with the id manualid. Would override any existing paste there.
$ curl -X PUT -u "anything:YOUR_PASSWORD" --data 'hello world' {{root_url}}/manualid

# Upload file.txt with the id manualid. Would override any existing paste there.
curl -X PUT -u ":YOUR_PASSWORD" --data @file.txt  http://localhost:8000/manualid
